Senior Year of High School Project - Dice Game 

# **Senior Year of High School Project**
The Java Project was based on OOP and made a GUI interface. 

The Project included Two Games: 
  - **First Game**: Prints out the amount of turns it took for a die, to roll all the same numbers.
  - **Second Game**: User v Computer Game, where the die rolls randomly for both the Computer <br/> and 
                       the User, and then points were deducted automatically. The player who reached
                       zero first, loses.
